dot files for vim with just a few plugins to aid in Latex editing

I wanted a minimal, non intrusive setup for Latex editing. See for instance the modified hyper minimal almost monochrome grey theme. No actual Latex plugins are used, as I find them all to be somewhat outdated slow and buggy. Instead fall back on latexmk, ultisnips, and ctags for cite/ref completion. 
If you want to mirror this I would suggest deleting the undo, and view folders.
